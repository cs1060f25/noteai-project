**Prompt Used:**  
> Design a web dashboard interface for a Lecture Highlights feature that displays short educational video clips automatically generated from long lectures. Use Google’s Material Design system with cards, progress indicators, and a navigation sidebar. Each video card should show a thumbnail, title, duration, and status (Processing or Completed).

**Summary:**  
This prototype explores a Google Material Design look for the NoteAI lecture highlights dashboard. It’s a clean, familiar layout with clear visual hierarchy.

**What I Learned:**  
Material Design is a reliable starting point for educational dashboards—highly usable and structured—but the style can feel overly generic and might require custom branding for personality.
