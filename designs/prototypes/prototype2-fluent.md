**Prompt Used:**  
> Create a Microsoft Fluent Design–inspired lecture highlights dashboard for NoteAI. Use frosted-glass surfaces, subtle shadows, and depth cues typical of Fluent Design. Include a sidebar with filters (All | Processing | Completed), a top bar with the NoteAI logo and upload button, and rounded cards for video highlights showing thumbnail, title, duration, and progress. Target desktop and tablet users.

**Summary:**  
This prototype experiments with Microsoft’s Fluent Design to give the dashboard a smoother, glassy aesthetic with depth and polish.

**What I Learned:**  
Fluent Design feels professional and elegant, improving visual appeal on desktop. However, it adds visual complexity and requires careful handling of transparency and contrast to maintain accessibility.
