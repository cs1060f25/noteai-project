**Prompt Used:**  
> Create a mobile-first, accessible dashboard for the Lecture Highlights feature. Use large touch-friendly buttons, single-column scrolling cards, and high-contrast colors. Add icons for captions or audio playback to support accessibility. Include a floating “+ Upload Lecture” button and simple navigation tabs. Design for small phone screens with readable typography and strong color contrast.

**Summary:**  
This prototype rethinks the dashboard for mobile and accessibility. It focuses on a single-column layout, larger targets, and high-contrast colors.

**What I Learned:**  
Mobile-first design clarifies priorities—uploading and viewing highlights are front and center. It’s more inclusive for novice or low-vision users but sacrifices dense information and multitasking capabilities.
