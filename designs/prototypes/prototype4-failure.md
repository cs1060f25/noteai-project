# Prototype 4 – Command-Line / Conversational UI (Failure)
Linked Linear Issue: NOTEAI-12  
Branch: feature/mirandalshen-p4-cli  
Figma Design: [View in Figma](https://www.figma.com/make/ecgVpJFheGrnDFRp0X6At8/Command-Line-Interface-for-NoteAI?node-id=0-4&t=Ee8NfK0UH42gtQXx-1)  
Screenshot: See Google Doc  

**Prompt Used:**  
> Generate a command-line-style interface for NoteAI’s Lecture Highlights feature. The user types commands like `/upload lecture.mp4` or `/list highlights`. Display responses as terminal-style text messages with monospace fonts and a dark background. Show an example conversation where the system reports “Processing lecture.mp4 (67 %)”. Keep it minimal, purely text-based, to illustrate why this approach is unsuitable for video dashboards.

**Summary:**  
A text-only command-line mock of the Lecture Highlights workflow. It highlights inefficiencies and usability issues when removing graphical elements.

**What I Learned:**  
This prototype deliberately fails for visual content. The CLI is efficient for developers but unusable for educators or students, reinforcing that NoteAI requires a GUI to show progress, thumbnails, and playback.
